# Kalman Filter Practice

Hi :) In this repository, I work on a practice about the Kalman Filter.

## Overview

This project explores the implementation of the Kalman Filter algorithm, a powerful tool for estimating the state of a dynamic system from a series of incomplete and noisy measurements.

## Repository Structure

- `Kalman Filter.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the Kalman Filter in action.
- `Datasets/`: Contains datasets used for testing and validation.
- `Pictures/`: Includes visualizations generated during the experiments.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ErfanJoodi/Kalman-Filter-Practice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Kalman-Filter-Practice
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Kalman Filter.ipynb"
   ```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib)

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
